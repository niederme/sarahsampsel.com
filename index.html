          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">As someone who has worked brand-side and now agency-side, I think about digital products in a holistic way – how to create the best possible solution, how it performs and how it will impact revenue. My experience at Work &amp; Co, and previously at the Washington Post, has given me a unique outlook – developing new concepts versus building upon existing ones is vastly different, but I find that thinking from both ends of that spectrum can enhance the process.</p>

          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">I was born in Erie, PA, one of the <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-01-27/worlds-snowiest-cities-valdez-aomori-city-syracuse" target="_blank">snowiest cities in the world</a>. I was raised to think creatively, love the outdoors, take adventures, and eat Polish food. I’m still that, for the most part, but now I’m based in Brooklyn, NY with John and Katya. Prior to New York, I lived in Washington D.C. for several years and met many amazing lifelong friends.
          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">In school, I studied art and spent most of my time sculpting, making ceramics, reading about art history, drawing and writing. I also love watercolors.</p>
          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">Skiing and traveling are my passions and I am obsessed with mountains.</p>
