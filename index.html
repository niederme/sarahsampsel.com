              <p class="xs-mb2">I opened a product design office in NYC to lead redesign efforts for the Washington Post's web platform. We worked on scope, strategy and execution of a site-wide rethink involving CMS capabilities as well as consumer-facing experiences.</p>
              <p class="xs-mb2">I built the team from scratch, hiring 6 design and strategy veterans from different industries with experience in solving complex design challenges, research, UX, and product development.</p>

              <p class="xs-mb2">As readership habits changed and technology evolved, I had the honor of being a key voice in how to rethink core news products. I conceptualized and designed news products such as a live events platform, the politics app for Election 2012, an enterprise story template and created and evolved the designs for the iPad app.</p>
              <p class="xs-mb2">Worked in partnership with companies like Google, Tumblr, Storify, Twitter and Facebook on creating new products for news consumption.</p>
              <p class="xs-mb2">Had the privilege of working on digital storytelling methods and presentations for award-winning journalism projects that millions of people see. Some examples include Top Secret America, Muslims In America and the 2 presidential elections.</p>

          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">As someone who has worked brand-side and now agency-side, I think about digital products in a holistic way – how to create the best possible solution, how it performs and how it will impact revenue. My experience at Work &amp; Co, and previously at the Washington Post, has given me a unique outlook – developing new concepts versus building upon existing ones is vastly different, but I find that thinking from both ends of that spectrum can enhance the process.</p>

          <h2 class="h4 xs-mt8 xs-pt2 xs-mb4 xs-type-brand bold italic xs-border-top">A Short Bio</h2>
          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">I was born in Erie, PA, one of the <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-01-27/worlds-snowiest-cities-valdez-aomori-city-syracuse" target="_blank">snowiest cities in the world</a>. I was a tomboy who enjoyed playing outside and getting muddy. My pants always had grass stains. I was raised to love Polish food, picnics, and road trips in the station wagon. I’m still that, for the most part, but now based in Brooklyn, NY with John and Katya.</p>
          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">I was an art major in college and spent most of my time sculpting, making ceramics, drawing and writing. I love watercolors.</p>
          <p class="xs-mb2 md-mr10 md-pr6 lg-mr0 lg-pr0">Skiing is my passion and I obsess over mountains. Travel is my favorite hobby. When I get home from work, I want to cook a delicious meal, drink wine and listen to Prince records. My family and friends are the only reason I still have a Facebook account (also, they’re all the best).</p>
